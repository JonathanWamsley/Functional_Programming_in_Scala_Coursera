# Conditionals and Value Definitions

### Conditional Expressions

to express choosing between two alternatives, scala uses if-else
> def abs(x: Int) = if (x >= 0) x else -x
x >=0 is a predicate, of type Boolean
>
### Boolean Expressions

Boolean expressions b can be composed of
- constants
    - true
    - false
- negation
    - !b
- conjunction
    - b && b
- disjunction
    - b || b
- comparisons
    - b <= b
    - b < b
    - b == b
    - b >= b
    - b > b
    - b !- b
    
Note that && and || do not always need their right operand to be evaluated (can be short-circuit evaluation)

### Value Definitions

we have seen that function parameters can be passed by value or be passed by name

The same applies to functions  

the def form is 'by-name', its right hand side is evaluated on each use

there is also a val for 'by-value'
> val x = 2

the right-hand side of val definition is evaluated at the point of the definition itself

### value definitions and terminations

 the difference between val and def becomes apparent when the right hand side does not terminate
 
> def loop: Boolean = loop
>
> def x = loop
>
> val x = loop (puts in inf loop) 
>

### Exercise
write functions and and or such that for all argument expressions x and y are evaluated similarly

do not use || or && in your implementation
- to short-circuit evaluation use => to call by name, so if and(false,loop) returns false

> def and(x: Boolean, y:=> Boolean) = if(x) y else false
>
> def and(x: Boolean, y:=> Boolean) = if(!x) false else y
>
> def or(x: Boolean, y:=> Boolean) = if(x) true else y
>
> def or(x:Boolean,y: =>Boolean) = if(!x) y else true
