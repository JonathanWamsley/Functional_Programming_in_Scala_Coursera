# Square roots with Newton's method

### Task

We will define a function

/** Calculates the square root of parameter x */
def sqrt(x: Double): Double = ...

the classical way to achieve this is by successive approximations using Newton's method

### Method

to compute sqrt(x)
- start with initial estimate( lets pick y = 1)
- repeatedly improve the estimate by taking the mean of y and x/y

Example  

| Estimation | Quotient            | Mean   |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| 1          | 2 / 1 = 2           | 1.5    |
| 1.5        | 2 / 1.5 = 1.333     | 1.4167 |
| 1.4167     | 2 / 1.4167 = 1.4118 | 1.4142 |

### Implementation in Scala (1)

First, define a function which computes on iteration step

def sqrtIter(guess: Double, x: Double) Double =
  if (isGoodEnough(guess, x)) guess
  else sqrtIter(improve(guess, x), x)
  
- Note that sqrtIter is recursive, its right-hand side calls itself
- recursive functions need an explicit return type in Scala
- for non-recursive functions, the return type is optional
