# 1.1 Programming Paradigms

### Programming Paradigms

Paradigm: describes distinct concepts or thought patterns in some scientific discipline.

Main programming paradigms:  
- imperative programming
- functional programming
- logical programming

Orthogonal to it:
- object-oriented programming

### Imperative programming

- modifying mutable variables
- using assignments
- control structures
    - if-then-else
    - loops
    - breaks
    - continue 
    - returns

The most common informal way to understand imperative programs is as instruction sequences for a Von Neumann computer

### imperative programs and computers

There is a strong correspondence between
- Mutable variables
    - memory cells
- variable dereferences
    - load instructions
- variable assignments
    - store instructions
- control structures
    - jumps
    
Problem: scaling up. How can we avoid conceptualizing programs word by word?

### Scaling up

In the end, pure imperative programming is limited by the 'Von Neumann' bottleneck:
> one tends to conceptualize data structures word-by-word.
>
We need other techniques for defining high-level abstractions such as collections, polynomials, geometric shapes, strings, documents.

Ideally: develop theories of collections, shapes, strings, ...

### What is a theory?

a theory consist of 
- one or more data types
- operations of these types
- laws that describe the relationship between values and operations

### Consequences for Programming

if we want to implement high-level concepts following their mathematical theories, there is no place for mutation.

- the theories do not admit it
- mutation can destroy useful laws in the theories

Therefore, lets:
- concentrate on defining theories for operators expressed as functions
- avoid mutations
- have powerful ways to abstract and compose functions

### Functional Programming

- in a restricted sense, functional programming (FP) means programming without mutable variables, assignments, loops, and other imperative control structures.
    - is one which does not have mutable variables, assignments, or imperative control structures

- in a wider-sense, functional programming means focusing on the functions
    - enables the construction of elegant programs that focus on functions
    
- in particular, functions can be values that are produced, consumed, and composed
    - are first-class citizens
        - they can be defined anywhere (including inside other functions)
        - they can be passed as parameters to functions and returned as results
        - as for other values, there exists a set of operators to compose functions
        
- all this becomes easier in a functional language

### restricted functional programming languages
- Pure lisp
- Xpath
- Haskell without Monad or UnsafePerformIO

### wider sense functional programing languages
- Lisp, Clojure
- SML, Ocaml, F#
- Haskell (full language)
- Scala
- smalltalk, Ruby

### Why functional programming?

functional programming is becoming increasingly popular, because it offers the benefits of:
- simpler reasoning principles
- better modularity
- good for exploiting parallelism for multicore and cloud computing
