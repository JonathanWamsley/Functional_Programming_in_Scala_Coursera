# 2.1 Higher-Order Functions

### higher-order functions

Functional languages treat functions as *first-class* values

This means that, like any other value, a function can be passed as a parameter and returned as a result.

This provides a flexible way to compose programs.

Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions as a result are called *higher order functions*.

### example

Take the sum of the integer between a and b:

def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int): Int = 
  if (a > b) 0 else a + sumInts(a+1, b)
  
Take the sum of the cubes of all the integers between a and b:

def cube(x: Int): Int = x * x * x

def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
  if (a > b) 0 else cube(a) + sumCubes(a + 1, b)
  
Take the sum of the factorials of all the integers between a and b:

def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
  if (a > b) 0 else fact(a) + sumFactorials(a + 1, b)
  
These are special cases of summation from a to b of f(n)

for different values of f. can we factor out the common patter?

### summing with higher-order functions

lets define: 

def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): Int =
  if (a > b) 0
  else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)
  
we can then write:

def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(id, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(cube, a, b)
def sumFactorials(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(fact, a, b)

where 

def id(x: Int): Int = x
def cube(x: Int): Int = x * x * x
def fact(x: Int): Int = if (x == 0) 1 else fact(x - 1)

### function types

The type A => B is the type of a function that takes an argument A and returns a result of type B

So, Int => Int is the type of functions that map integers to integers

### anonymous functions

passing functions as parameters leads to the creation of many small functions
- sometimes it is tedious to have define (and name) these functions using def

compare to stringsL we dont need to define a string using def

def str = "abc"; println(str)

we can directly write

println("abc")

because strings exist as literals. Analogously we would like function literals, which let us write a function without giving it a name.

These are called anonymous functions

### anonymous function syntax

A function that raises its argument to a cube

(x: Int) => x * x * x

here, (x: Int) is the parameter of the function, and x * x * x is the body

- the type of the parameter can be omitted if it can be inferred by the compiler from contex

if there are several parameters, they are separated by comas

(x: Int, y: Int) => x + y

### anonymous functions are syntactic sugar

an anonymous function (x_1 : T_1, ... x_n: T_n) => E can always be expressed using def as follows:

def f(x_1: T_1, ..., x_n, T_n) = E;f

where f is an arbitrary, fresh name
- one can therefore say that anonymous functions are syntactic sugar

### summation with anonymous functions

using anonymous functions, we can write sums in a shorter way

def sumInts(a: Int,b: Int) = sum(x => x, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int) = sum(x => x * x * x)

### exercise

the sum function uses linear recursion. write a tail-recursive version by replacing the ???

def sum(f: Int => Int)(a: Int, b:int): Int = {  
  def loop(a: Int, acc: Int): Int = {  
    if(a > b) acc  
    else loop(a + 1, acc + f(a))  
  }  
  loop(a, 0)  
}  

sum(x = > x * x, 3, 5) results 50
9 + 16 + 25 = 50
