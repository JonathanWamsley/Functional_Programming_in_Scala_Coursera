# Tail Recursion

### Review: evaluation a function application

One simple rule: One evaluates a function application f(e_1, ... e_n) by:
- evaluating the expressions e_1,...,e_n resulting in the values v_1,...,v_n
- replacing the application with the body of the function f
- the actual parameters v1,...,v_n replace the formal parameters of f

### Application rewriting rule

This can be formalized as rewriting of the program itself

> def f(x_1,...,x_n) = B; ... f(v_1, ... V_n)
> def f(x_1,...,x_n) = B; ... [v_1/x_1, ... V_n/x_n]B

Here [v_1/x_1, ... V_n/x_n]B means:  
the expression B in which all occurrences of x_i have been replaced by v_i  
[v_1/x_1, ... V_n/x_n] is called a substitution

### Rewriting example:

consider gcd, the function that computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers.  

Here is an implementation of gcd using Euclid's algorithm.

> def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
>  if (b == 0) a else gcd(b, a % b)

gcd(14, 21)  
gcd(21, 7)
gcd(7, 0)
returns 7


notice how the recursion return changes at the end in a single stack (tail recursion) 
### factorial rewriting example

> def factorial(n: Int): Int =
>  if (n==0) 1 else n * factorial(n-1)

factorial(4)  
4 * factorial(3)  
4 * 3 * factorial(2)  
4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)  
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(0)  
4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * returns 1  
24

This uses a tail-calls recursion since there are a stack of calls being added to retain the final value

### Tail recursion

- implementation consideration: if a function calls itself as its last action, the functions stack frame can be reused
- this is called tail recursion
- can be done in constant space(functional form of a loop)

- Tail recursive functions are iterative processes
- in general, if the last action of a function consists of calling a function (which may be the same), one stack frame would be sufficient for both functions.
- this is called tail-calls
- can lead to stack overflow frames and should be avoided 


### exercise

design a tail-recursive version of factorial


/ can give factorial a default total
def factorial(n :Int, total:Int = 1)
  if (n == 0) total else factorial(n-1, total)
