# Elements of Programming

### Every non-trivial programming language provides:
- primitive expressions representing the simplest elements
- ways to combine expressions
- ways to abstract expressions 

### The read-eval-print loop

Functional Programming is a bit like using a calculator:
- an interactive shell, Read-Eval-Print-Loop(REPL) lets one write expressions and responds with their value  
- The scala REPL can be started by:
    - in terminal with scala
    
### A non-primitive expression is evaluated as:
1. take the leftmost operator
2. evaluate its operands (left before right)
3. apply the operator to the operands

- a name is evaluated by replacing it with the right hand side of its definition
- the evaluation process stops once it results in a value
- a value is a number (for the moment)
- take-away: This is like math order of operations flow

### parameter and return types

Functional parameters come with their type, which is given after a colon

> def power(x: Double, y: Int): Double = ...

If a return type is given, it follows the parameter list

Primitive types are as in Java, but are written capitalized
- Int: 32-bit integers
- Double: 64-bit floating point numbers
- Boolean: true or false

### evaluation of function applications

Applications of parameterized functions are evaluated by:
1. evaluate all function arguments, from left to right
2. replace the function application by the function's right-hand side, and, at the same time
3. replace the formal parameters of the function by the actual arguments

example using: sumOfSquares(3, 2+2)
1. sumOfSquares(3,2+2)
2. sumOfSquares(3,4)
3. square(3) + square(4)
4. 3 * 3 + square(4)
5. 9 + square(4)
6. 9 + 4 * 4
7. 9 + 16
8. 25

### the substitution model

- The idea underlying this model is that all evaluation does is reduce an expression to a value.
- it can be applied to all expressions, as long as they have no side effects
- it is formalized in the lambda calculus, giving its foundation for functional programming

### termination

- does every expression reduce to a value?
- no. by counter example:
    > def loop: Int = loop
    loop -> loop -> ....
So you would have to evaluate the name, which happens by replacing the name with its right hand side. So the name is reduced to itself inf times
 
### Changing the evaluation strategy

alternatively apply the function to unreduced arguments
1. sumOfSquares(3,2+2)
2. square(3) + square(2+2)
3. 3 * 3 + square(2+2)
4. 9 + square(2+2)
5. 9 + (2+2) * (2+2)
6. 9 + 4 * (2+2)
7. 9 + 4 * 4
8. 25

### Call-by-name and call-by-value

- the  first evaluation strategy is known as call-by-value
    - advantage is it evaluates every function argument once only
- the second evaluation strategy is known as call-by-name
    - advantage is that a function argument is not evaluated if the corresponding paramter is unused in the evaluation of the function body
    
Both strategies reduce to the same final value as long as:  
- the reduce expression consist of pure functions
- both evaluations terminate

### comparing evaluation strategies

The faster approach will be the one with fewer reduction steps
