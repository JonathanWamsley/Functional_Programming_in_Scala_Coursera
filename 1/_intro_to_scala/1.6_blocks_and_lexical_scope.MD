# Blocks and Lexical Scope

### Nested functions

- functional programming style likes to split of task into smaller task
- functions like sqrtIter, improve, and isGoodEnough matter only for the implementation of sqrt, not for its usage
- we would not like users to access these functions directly
- we can achieve this and at the same time avoid 'name-space pollution' by
    - putting the auxiliary functions inside sqrt
    
to reformat the scope
    - select all the methods and place them inside the the sqrt method with {}
    
   
### Blocks in Scala

- a block is delimited by braces {}  
    { val x = f(x)  
      x * x  
    }  
- it contains a sequence of definitions or expressions
- the last element of a block is an expression that defines its value
- this return express can be preceded by auxiliary definitions
- blocks are themselves expressions; a block may appear everywhere an expression can


### Blocks and visibility

- the definition inside a block are only visible from within the block
- the definition inside a block shadow definitions of the same names outside the block
    - so if there are 2 variables named x, the most recent called one in the block will be refered to
    
### exercise

val x = 0  
def f(y: Int) = y + 1  
val result = {  
  val x = f(3)  
  x * x  
} + x  

what is the result of this program?  
val x = (f(3))  
x = (3 + 1)
x = 4
return 4 * 4 = 16
result = {16} + x (refers to out of block where x = 0)  
result = 16

### lexical scoping

- definitions of out blocks are visible inside a block unless they are shadowed
- therefore, we can simplify sqrt by eliminating redundant occurrences of the x parameter

### Semicolons

- in Scala, semicolons at the end of lines are optional
- if there are more than one statement on a line, they need to be separated by semicolons

> val y = x + 1; y * y
 
### Semicolons and infix operators

- how to write expressions that span several lines (over 100 char?) and wrap to second line
- wrap inside () or use a + operator as the last element on the first line which the compiler knows to go to next line

### Summary 

You have seen simple elements of functional programming in Scala.  
- arithmetic and boolean expressions
- conditional expressions if-else
- functions with recursion
- nesting and lexical scope

- you have learned the different evaluation strategies:
    - call-by-name
    - call-by-value
- you have learned a way to reason about program execution:
    - reduce expressions using the substitution model
- this model will be an important tool for coming sessions
