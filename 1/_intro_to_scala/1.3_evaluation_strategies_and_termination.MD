# 1.3 Evaluation Strategies and Termination

### call-by-name, call-by-value and termination

- what happens if termination is not guaranteed?
    - if CBV evaluation of an expression e terminates, then CBN evaluation of e terminates too
    - the other direction is not true
    
examples:
> def first(x: Int, y: Int) = x
> and consider the expression first(1, loop)

Under CBN:
1. first(1, loop)
2. 1

Under CBV:
1. first(1, loop)
2. inf loop, since loop reduces to itself loop inf times
3. never terminates

In scala, call by value is used.
for functions in practice, CBV tends to be more efficient than CBN because it avoids this repeated recomputation of argument expressions that CBN entails. 
 
It also works better with imperative effects and side effects because you tend to know much better when expressions will be evaluated
 
If you want scala to call by value, you can add an arrow
> def constOne(x: Int, y: => Int) = 1
